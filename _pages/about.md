I am a Student pursuing Computer Science at [**BITS Pilani, India**](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in). I love solving problems with C++. View my Leetcode Profile [here](https://leetcode.com/nilanjan172nsvian/). Currently I am solving Problems using basic data structure like arrays, linked list, strings and using some simple high school mathematics only. I will publish all algorithms by which I solved this Problem. If anyone found a better approach to solve the Problem kindly discuss on **Discussion Forum** or Contribute to github as described on [**Contribute**](https://nil1729.github.io/LEETCODE-001/contribute/) Page.
