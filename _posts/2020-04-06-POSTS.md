I am a first year Computer Science Student at BITS PILANI, Rajasthan. I am Currently solving Problems using basic data structure like arrays, linked list, strings and using some simple high school mathematics. I will provide all algorithms by which I solved this Problem. If anyone found a better approach to solve this Problem kindly discuss on [**Discussion Forum**] or Contribute to github as described on [**Contribute**](https://nil1729.github.io/LEETCODE-001/contribute/) section. I Love solving Problems using CPP. Currently I am trying to develop myself as a Frontend Developer.
